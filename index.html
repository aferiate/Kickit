                                    <p class="mb-4">    Our first project, the nametag, was designed to teach us the 3D printing process, which starts as either a .3MF or a .STL file. My process was all based on instructions given orally and in the project description file. I started by importing the nametag template file given into Prusa Slicer— the program designed for the Prusa MINI+— and the software scales and places a model of the object onto a representation of the 3D print base. Then, I edited the template name tag and font to change it to be my name and my aesthetic preference. I hit “Slice,” telling the program that the file is finalized and this is what will be sent to print. I then grabbed a USB drive, plugged it into my computer, and dragged the file into the drive. I brought the USB drive to one of the Prusa MINI+ 3D printers and plugged it in. This time, the printer was already ready to print, but it may need to be turned on and/or loaded with filament.  The Prusa MINI+ automatically suggested to print the most recently added file to the drive; I hit print and it started doing so. 
    After the first layer finished, the Prusa MINI+ stopped printing and beeped to tell the user it was ready for a color change. I pulled the end of the spool of filament out of the printer, then grabbed a different colored spool and inserted it. The printer asked if I was ready, and upon hitting “continue” I pushed the filament in further as the gear inside loaded it in. The printer tested to see if the new color was working, which it was, so I clicked as such and it went on printing the next color, finishing within a few minutes.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Our second project, the Torture Test, was designed to push the Prusa Mini to its limits. I chose this spider, an intricate design with strange angles and small outshoots. The main constraint of the printer that this ran up against was overhangs. When a part of a design extends outward from its base, with no direct support underneath, it can be very challenging to print; the nozzle ends up extruding plastic straight into the air without it connecting to anything below. The typical rule, though, is any overhang with less than a 45 degree angle to its base is able to support itself. Overall, the details in this print were suitable for both the file and the print, but some hidden features kept it stable, like printing starting at the body and ending at the legs, and having a small flat plane on the top of the body to ensure bed adhesion. Even with all these, there were still many stringy, small filaments protruding from the legs, a result of the hot nozzle traveling far distances across space and leaking instead of traveling more distance across what had been printed and improving the aesthetic product. The file here was originally a .STL file, which only encodes geometry of the 3D model. Once passing through Prusa Slicer, however, the file becomes a .3MF file, which both encodes geometry as well as printer settings, like filament specifications, color changes, supports, cooling rates, etc.

                                    <p class="mb-4">For this project, the aim was to print some kind of assistive device that has some utility; I chose this finger pen holder. This print proved to be fairly easy- the shape is simple and small- although it needed a plethora of organic supports due to the large overhang in the middle. But after removing the supports, it worked very well. This design, which was created by “Makers Making Change,” a Canadian nonprofit aiming to distribute assistive technology to those who need it, is meant for those with impaired grip strength “like those with arthritis, spinal cord injuries, and muscular dystrophy.” After some testing, I found it to be robust and effective at its task, alleviating grip tension needed to hold a normal pencil tightly. The print documentation was sufficient, (it suggested 90% infill, though 15 was fine) it just neglected to mention the need for supports to mitigate the overhang. My only suggestions for a next prototype would be somehow making both the pen holder side and the finger side adjustable to allow for user preferences of comfort, etc.

                                    <p class="mb-4">During this summer, I had a vision for a design I wanted to implement in this class: a sensory fidget to replace an unhealthy hair-picking habit. So, I jumped right into Tinkercad, bypassing most of the tutorials, learning through trial and error,  and looking up specific functions when necessary. I found this interface to be fairly intuitive- every shape could be made of a combination of simpler shapes (cubes, cones, spheres, cylinders, etc). But while my method of learning allowed me to do the things I wanted, it didn’t teach me the fastest or easiest ways to do so, and I wasted a lot of time meticulously moving parts.

                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/fidgetprototype.jpeg" alt="..." />
                                   <p class="mb-4">Then, I went on to prototype 2 (and 3) in Fusion. I found Fusion to be more formidable- its UI was sleeker and gave more options/freedom, but the controls were unintuitive. Simple tasks, like moving/rotating parts, changing size, and duplicating around an axis were much harder to figure out. But it proved to be rewarding, as once I knew how to do these actions, they became simpler (harder to slip and make mistakes) and more reliable. Additionally, Fusion made it really easy to edit a bunch of identical bodies at once in the same way, much harder with Tinkercad. The final products (below in black) feel more robust, symmetrical, and easier to remix later. The reason I did a third prototype was because the second one was too large for my sensory goals- it didn't match the sensation I had in mind. On this third go I chose to use a smaller nozzle diameter of 0.2 mm rather than 0.4 to try and make the detail resolve better in such a small print.

                                    <p class="mb-4">For the first remix, I realized I needed a comb. I personally prefer ones with handles, as I like the tactile feel better. So, my idea was to take a public file for a comb, put it in Tinkercad, and add a simple handle (with grooves for my fingers). Below is my initial sketch:</p>

                                     <p class="mb-4">After finding the file for a comb on Thingiverse and putting it in Tinkercad, the next steps were simple: take a cylinder, flatten it, and add half cylinder holes evenly spaced on one side for finger holes. One note was that the outline of parts followed the alignment of the workspace grid, not of the axis of the piece (i.e. a rectangle angled diagonally would still have its edges marked by X-Y), inclining me to edit the size of the parts before facing them diagonally to make it fit on the printing bed. </p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/newcombTC.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p class="mb-4">When printing, I needed to include a brim, as the ovular shape of the handle would not have any bed adhesion otherwise. I also needed supports for the comb portion (I used Snug as it seemed safest) and these were really tricky to remove. Organic supports are way easier to handle. Besides scaling my model down to 92% size, I used all normal system presets.</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/newcombPS.png" alt="..." />
                                    <p class="mb-4">I was happy with my print, and went to test it on my hair, noticing it was fairly flimsy. Unfortunately, upon a second pass, the print snapped at the intersection. I remembered that in my design, I had connected the two parts by having a single tooth of the comb intersect the handle-- a silly decision. If I were to redo my design, I’d give far more overlap for structural integrity.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">My friend loves tea and koalas, so I wanted to remix this as a Koala. I searched up a free koala file, and imported both files into Fusion as mesh. After some investigation on how to directly edit parts, I found the tool, and manually went into the Fisherman, removing his hat and head. I moved the koala file to be sitting on top of the “fisherman,” now more a seat, and exported this combo (along with the bag holder behind it) into Prusa Slicer.

                                    <p class="mb-4">This print did not need a brim, but it was still on from the last print. It did need supports, of which it auto added too many for my liking. I put the overhang threshold to 30, and it added much less, saving 10 minutes of printing and over a gram of unnecessary PLA. The rest of the settings were unchanged from default. When printed (and assembled, placing the fishing pole inside the hole), it looked like this:

                                     <p class="mb-4">I didn't get the chance to test it out, but it seemed structurally sound and like it would work as intended. If I were to iterate again, I would make a color difference between the koala and its seat/fishing rod for aesthetic preferences, and maybe make the shape of the seat more seatlike. I would potentially also make the gap that hugs the mug edge thinner for a tighter grip.</p>

The biggest drawback with these instructions, compounded with a lack of color, is that it looks very cluttered; arrows point to where each component goes, making it a bit more difficult to understand at first glance. The smaller radio instructions are far less detailed, with every instruction basically being “Install” *x* at *location*. However, it provides a QR code linking to a more in depth document, with color photos for each step that look very helpful. This is especially important for the resistors, which are color coded.

                                    <p class="mb-4">When beginning, I made this plan:
“My design plan for the 3D printed enclosure is to do something similar to the intended enclosure as provided. I will have a hole for the power button and 5 holes for the other 5 buttons; this will afford being able to turn on and off power and change the volume or station. I will have some of the top cut out to afford antenna movement, and large rectangular holes along the front to allow the speaker to be heard through the plastic.”

                                    <p class="mb-4">These functions all came to fruition through multiple iterations, as well as including holes on the sides for the headphones and USB charger. Above are said iterations, going up on the left then up on the right from earliest to latest. I started by testing those flat sheets for the button hole sizes and separations, as they took under 10 minutes to print each. The main thing I realized (besides my forgetting to account for the buttons’ diameters in their separations) was the importance of tolerances; it was necessary to add up to 1-2mm of diameter for each hole just to allow for a smooth fit. This making cutouts larger than necessary was a theme throughout the design process. I made one more half box to test depth, then moved onto a full print. I continued adding features like the speaker cutout and the antenna cutout piecemeal while adjusting the side hole locations. Below is my final iteration in Prusa Slicer:

                                    <p class="mb-4">Finally, I designed and printed a back to contain all the pieces, resulting in my final iteration below:

                                     <p class="mb-4">The process for the laser cut enclosure was far quicker. First, I imported the parameters from my 3D print design in Fusion, saving a lot of time of reentry. I then followed the finger joint tutorial provided in the instructions, but set to my personal constraints, and printed a plain box. Once that was finished, I was able to pick a side to refine without necessarily cutting the rest of the box- one of the clear advantages of the laser cutter. Then, I copied over my 3D printed design into the laser cutter Fusion tab, made a sketch over it copying its features, then overlaid it over the wooden face I had previously cut. I extruded out the same exact holes from the 3D print into the wood, making a perfect replica of the constraints from before, except out of wood. The final product is below:

                                    <p class="mb-4">This project was very enjoyable, and I got to go through the many steps of design, iteration, and refinement to make a final outcome I was actually satisfied with.
